TweetMe
=======

A Wordpress plugin that posts a tweet to Twitter when you publish a blog post

INSTALLATION:

 cd wordpress/wp-content/plugins/
 git clone git://github.com/whomwah/tweetme.git 

Now go to your admin panel and activate it.

NON-GIT INSTALL:

Once you downloaded all files create a folder called 'tweetme' in your plugins folder. 
Then place the tweetme.php file in that directory so it looks something like this:

  wp-content/plugins/
    + wp-content/plugins/tweetme/
      + wp-content/plugins/tweetme/tweetme.php
